# **TIPS**

1) if you had any lumps at your batter you can easily remove them by puting them in a mixer or grinder..

2) before bakingg if you dont want your cake to be messed up in the container only so you can use a butter paper at the bottom and greese it with butter..

3) add baking powder before 5 mins of baking otherwise it will not get airy and will not taste good..
